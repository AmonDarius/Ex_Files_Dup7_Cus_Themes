Using Backup Migrate module to create content for web site

Directions
-----------------
1) Extract the sites.zip file and replace your Drupal sites folder with this version
2) Restore the SAMOCA database with the "samoca.mysql.zip" file


The Content for SAMOCA is composed of Pages, Blocks and Views and a Custom Content type for Exhibits.
If you are unfamiliar with how Block and Views function in Drupal 7 then please refer to Drupal 7: Essential Training and Drupal 7: Reporting and Visualizing Data

Note: In a previous video "Installing prebuilt themes" we installed a couple of themes for the Front-end and Back-end appearance.  Those themes have been removed in the sites.zip and samoca.sql.zip files going forward as they will not be used for the remaining videos in this series.
