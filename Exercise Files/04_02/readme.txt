How Drupal structures a theme based off of .info files, css, javascript, templates, etc

Drupal best practices suggest that any custom themes be places inside sites/all/themes within a folder with the name of the theme you are creating.

Inside of your theme folder (samoca) best practices suggests that css, images and javascript be within a folder called assets.

Also inside of your theme folder should be your theme's .info file (samoca.info) which contains all the metadata for your theme.  To better visually represent your theme you should create a screenshot of your theme names screenshot.png

Finally any custom templates you create or override should live within a templates folder to better organize your structure for theming purposes.
