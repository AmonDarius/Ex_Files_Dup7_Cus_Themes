Core Templates
-----------------------

Drupal core contains over forty template files, but there are six major template files that are responsible for the majority of HTML output.  We will be working with these files as we create our theme so it is a good idea to begin taking a look at these now in the Understanding Template Variables presentation.

Note: For a look at an overview of theme files refer to http://drupal.org/node/171194 

Template Suggestions
----------------------

What's a template suggestion? It's an alternate template (.tpl.php) file that you have created to override the base or original template file. Suggestions only work when they are placed in the same directory as the base templates.
