Understanding the new HTML template and how to customize it

The html.tpl.php template prints the structure of the HTML document, including the contents of <head> tags the $scripts and $styles variables, as well as the opening and closing <body> tags with $page_top and $page_bottom regions and the $page variable, which prints the Drupal output from the page.tpl.php template. Unless you need to change the DOCTYPE, thereâ€™s probably no reason to override this file.

Since we want to make sure our theme is HTML5 ready we will need to modify a copy of the html.tpl.php template.  Let's begin by:

- From your editor create a folder called "templates" inside the "sites/all/themes/samoca" folder
- Navigate to the "modules/system" folder and copy the "html.tpl.php" file to your "sites/all/themes/samoca/templates" folder
- Next Copy the index.html page from the exercise folder to your "sites/all/themes/samoca" folder
- Compare the heading of the index.html to that of the html.tpl.php page to see what elements need to be replaced
- Let's begin by replacing the !doctype with that of an HTML5 doctype and cleanup the <html> and <head> elements with the following html:


<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html dir="<?php print $language->dir; ?>">
<head>


- Browse to your Drupal instance and Flush the Drupal cache
- Preview the source code using Firebug

Since we are making sure are custom Drupal theme is HTML5 compliant we will take advantage of the JavaScript libraries Modernizr and Selectivizr.

- Begin by browsing back to your editor and creating a new folder called "js" inside of the "sites/all/themes/samoca/assets" folder
- Next either download a copy of Modernizr from "http://www.modernizr.com" or if your are a Lynda.com premium subscriber you can copy it from the exercise folder
- Open up the "sites/all/themes/samoca/samoca.info" file and add a script reference to Modernizr with the following metadata 

scripts[] = assets/js/modernizr.js

- Browse back to your Drupal instance and Flush the Drupal cache
- Review the code using Firebug and notice the reference to Modernizr and the new classes being added to the <html> element

Since Selectivizr relies on conditional statements we will add this directly to the html.tpl.php file and utilize some Drupal variables to access the file from the js folder

- Browse back to your editor and open up html.tpl.php from within your "sites/all/themes/samoca/templates" folder
- Add the following directly after the "print $scripts" statement

<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="<?php print base_path() . path_to_theme(); ?>/assets/js/selectivizr-min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

- Browse back to your Drupal instance and Flush the Drupal cache
- Since the code we added is meant to target Internet Explorer version 8 or less you will need to have a copy of Internet Explorer to view that code is being outputted correctly.

If you were able to follow along correctly then the completed htmlp.tpl.php file should look like this:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html dir="<?php print $language->dir; ?>">
<head>
  <?php print $head; ?>
  <title><?php print $head_title; ?></title>
  
  <?php print $styles; ?>
  <?php print $scripts; ?>

  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
	<script src="<?php print base_path() . path_to_theme(); ?>/assets/js/selectivizr-min.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->

</head>
<body class="<?php print $classes; ?>" <?php print $attributes;?>>
  <?php print $page_top; ?>
  <?php print $page; ?>
  <?php print $page_bottom; ?>
</body>
</html>
